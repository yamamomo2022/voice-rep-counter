This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a voice repetition counter project written in TypeScript. The repository is currently in its initial state and will be developed to track voice-based repetition counting functionality.

## Project Structure

The project is currently minimal with only a LICENSE file. As development progresses, this section should be updated to reflect the actual project architecture.

## Development Commands

*Note: Commands will be added here once the project structure is established with package.json and build tooling.*

## Architecture Notes

*This section will be populated as the codebase develops to document key architectural decisions and patterns used in the voice repetition counter implementation.*
